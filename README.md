## 12,000+ lines of code üî•

### Current Costumes (mod can be reslotted to any slot using gastly.marker file)

- Regular (c01)
- Shiny (c02)

## Core Evolution System

**Three-Stage Evolution Chain:**

- **Gastly** (starting form) ‚Üí **Haunter** ‚Üí **Gengar**
- Each stage has unique visuals, sounds, and behaviors
- Evolution requirements: Damage received + hits landed thresholds
- Real-time visual feedback showing evolution readiness

**Evolution Mechanics:**

- **Gastly ‚Üí Haunter**: 35% damage received + 10 hits landed
- **Haunter ‚Üí Gengar**: 50% damage received + 15 hits landed
- **Manual Evolution**: Haunter can evolve to Gengar via Up Taunt x2 while guarding (Linking Cord item)
- **Evolution Animation**: 240-frame (4 second window) transformation with special effects
- **Cancellation**: Down Taunt x2 (In Air or On Ground While Guarding) during evolving to cancel (with penalty). Penalty = current stage‚Äôs damage taken requirement + 15% damage needed to evolve. ie. If Gastly (1 cancel): (35% + 15% penalty); If Haunter (1 cancel): (50% + 15% penalty)

## Visual System

**Stage-Specific Meshes:**

Complete model replacements for each evolution stage-

- **Floor Shadow**: Special crouching animation meshes
- **Shadow Ball**: A stage-specific mesh copy of the corresponding Pokemon is seen posed & charging the shadow ball.
- **Ghost Form**: Down Taunt retro Pokemon ghost pixel art
- **Evolving Meshes**: Stage-specific during evolving window (uses model.nuanmb with a texture that matches similarly to the anime‚Äôs evolving visual - not just all white - if you look closely there‚Äôs some cyan/blue noise)

### Current limitations during development:

- **Incompatible with One-Slot Effects plugin** - causes a soft-lock/freeze on any character (global) if they throw an enemy. I managed to comment out an install function in code and it didn't freeze on my laptop (although the function is necessary), yet doing the same method froze on my desktop, so I decided to not utilize it.
- Dark effects purple overlay is based on camera depth due to how Flash macro is configured so it's not a fixed color shade overlay. It gets more opaque as the camera is zoomed out. `ColorBlendModule::set_main_color` caused the model to be completely gray at all times and configurations.
- I wanted a "damage % dealt to enemy" condition, but too complex to incorporate, so it was replaced with hit-count requirement to evolve in addition to the damage taken condition.
- Ghost (down taunt) not billboarded due to facing left causing issues visually (perhaps flip.prc related)
- Long tongue mesh/bones not flipped/mirrored properly when facing left during grab/pummel (perhaps flip.prc related)
- Can't get Gastly aura to occur during results screen lose status potentially due to results screen UI render layer issue
- Regarding dark/lick hits: Common vanilla sounds that are hit sounds -- I wanted to mute/stop them during my custom hit sounds, but it requires global fighter frame to mute/stop them seemingly, and I didn't care to add that complexity in case it interfered with other occurrences of that common sound playing. It's not a big deal anyway.
- Custom `chara_6` cutin UI was supposed to occur when Haunter and Gengar did their cry after evolving and their final smash. Also was for Mega Gengar final smash and Gigantamax Gengar final smash. Unfortunately, the cutin only shows up as black (The CSK Collection limitation).
- Custom `chara_3` swapping was a consideration for the results screen evolution stage outcome, but was not utilized due to chara_6 not working, so I considered chara_3 to not work or not worth testing it.
- The evolving sound(s) may cease if you are interrupted by a grab from an enemy.
- In Gastly duos (Gastly vs. Gastly), when a shiny Gastly (Player 2) dies as Haunter/Gengar and respawns as Gastly, two things happen:
1. Regular Gastly's UI flickers between Gastly ‚Üî Haunter/Gengar stages - it may, after some seconds, correctly become the correct evolution stage UI
2. Shiny Gastly's UI gets stuck showing Haunter/Gengar instead of updating to Gastly after respawn
    
    Suspected Root Cause: Despite implementing instance isolation with unique instance_key calculations and per-player UI state management, the the_csk_collection_api::change_entry_chara_ui() API
    appears to have some global behavior or shared state that causes cross-player interference. Multiple debugging approaches (stage change detection, staggered updates, validation layers, complete, UI resets) all failed to resolve the issue.

### Things I could add, but felt lazy/not as necessary/didn't want the project to drag on longer **(may be added as an update in the future)**:

- Moving eyes (not sure to what extent Jigglypuff's internal eye movement's noticeability or will translate to the kind of eyes Gastly evo has)
- Final smash eyes (would have to make sure the EyeL/EyeGL# structure works for this mod)
- Red bubbly clouds above Gigantamax Gengar (would have to model, create new bones animate them, code in new mesh - all for like 3-4 seconds of visibility. You could argue the evolution sequence was similarly short, but the evolution sequence was the most critical piece for this mod project)
- Custom chara_4 / chara_2 that occurs during Mega Gengar and Gigantamax Gengar
- Custom chara_2 stock icons for each stage (for now it's just the Pokemon shadow symbol / Pokemon shadow symbol + sparkle)
- More recolor slots (current ideas: 1) [https://x.com/TheYisusOne/status/1944396469601001590?t=SRxpQLMtqr8_OuIzuqOB6w&s=19](https://x.com/TheYisusOne/status/1944396469601001590?t=SRxpQLMtqr8_OuIzuqOB6w&s=19), 2) cel-shaded anime colors, 3) other ghost Pokemon color palette references)
